/*
    It's late at night. You hear a rumbling in the sky. 
    Suddenly a large crashing sound comes from your
    backyard. You leap from your bed and go outside to 
    investigate. Smoke is coming from behind your shed,
    and suddenly you see a set of eyes peering from the 
    darkness. An alien emerges. 
    Although he seems friendly, he speaks a strange language.
    It seems that every word he speaks consists 
    of the same sequence of letters forwards as it 
    does backwards. 
    To begin communicating with this strange creature, 
    you decide to write a program to determine if 
    a word can or cannot be interpreted by the alien.
